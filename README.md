# TrackPedesANN
> Using artificial neural network to detect and track pedestrian in real-time

## Main idea
- Using Deep Neural Network to detect pedestrian.
- Using Convolutional Neural Network to track the pedestrian, make sure the model will not lose the detected pedestrian.
- Using Recurrent Nerual Network to predit pedestrian's position in next frame?

## Language and platform
- Python
- x64 system

## Schedule
- [ ] Have read all references?
- [ ] Have determined the final architecture?
- [ ] Starting coding?
- [ ] Release a demo?
- [ ] Release the final version?

## Architecture
* Deep learning framework
  - [**`Tensorflow`**](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)(more flexible, slower) 
  - [**`Caffe`**](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe)(easier to use, faster)
* Initialization Method
  - [ ] Gaussian
  - [ ] Orthogonal initialization
  - [ ] LUSV initialization
  - [ ] Xavier initialization
  - [ ] Kaiming He initialization
* Preprocessing Method
  - [ ] PCA or ZCA Whitening
  - [ ] Substract mean images
  - [ ] Normalization

## Wait for determining
* [ ] Recurrent Neural Network?
* [ ] Residual Neural Network? (The newest neural network architecture, much faster and deeper)
* [ ] Do we need `gitter` or other online tools to communicate?
