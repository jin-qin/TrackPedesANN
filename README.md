# TrackPedesANN
> Using artificial neural network to detect and track pedestrian in real-time

## Main idea
- Using Deep Neural Network to detect pedestrian.
- Using Convolutional Neural Network to track the pedestrian, make sure the model will not lose the detected pedestrian.
- Using Recurrent Nerual Network to predit pedestrian's position in next frame?

## Language and platform
- Python
- x64 system

## Schedule
- [ ] Have read all references?
- [ ] Have determined the final architecture?
- [ ] Starting coding?
- [ ] Complete?

## Architecture
* Deep learning framework: 
  - [**`Tensorflow`**](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)(more flexible, slower) 
  - [**`Caffe`**](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe)(easier to use, faster)

## Wait for determining
* [ ] Recurrent Neural Network?
* [ ] Residual Neural Network? (The newest neural network architecture, much faster and deeper)
* [ ] Do we need `gitter` or other online tools to communicate?
